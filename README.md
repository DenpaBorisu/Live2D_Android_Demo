## Instalation

1. Download and import this package into unity
https://github.com/DenpaBorisu/Live2D_Android_Demo/releases/
2. Download and import the live2D SDK for unity (cant include all in one package because of reasons)
https://live2d.github.io/#unity
3. And then run the sample scene corresponding to this project.

## What does it do

Small app for android
* The character follows touch on the screen with the eyes
* Plays idle animations when theres no interaction
* Plays some other animations when the Cat or cookie are touched
* Plays another animation when the phone is shaked with enough force
* The background and foreground moves when the phone is moved relative to the magnetic north

## What can you do with it

This is intended as a example use for the Live2D SDK, to serve as a base and to facilitate the implementation of mobile apps with Live2D models.

You can replace the character and use your own, make another clickable areas and use your own animations and backgrounds.

Soon I will upload a small tutorial regarding this project.
